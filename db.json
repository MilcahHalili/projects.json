After many iterations and prototypes, from integrating a React front-end framework, which connected to the WooCommerce REST API, to finally migrating Freck's eCommerce platform from WooCommerce to Shopify in order to take advantage of their Liquid codebase, allowing a more seamless integration of AJAX and JavaScript. The result: a faster website, quicker checkout experience, happier users, and more sales.<br/>This is a test.",
